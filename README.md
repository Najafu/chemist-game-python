# Chemist Game

A Python implementation of the "Chemist" game, originally created by Wayne Teeter of Ridgecrest, California. Ported to Python by Philipp H. Rubner.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Chemist game! This project is a Python adaptation of the classic "Chemist" game, originally conceived by Wayne Teeter. The goal of the game is to successfully dilute a fictional chemical called "Kryptocyanic Acid" by adding the right amount of water. The game provides an engaging challenge that requires players to calculate and input the correct proportions of water to avoid disastrous consequences.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
3. Run the `chemist_game.py` script using your Python interpreter.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to enter the amount of water to dilute the acid.
5. Be careful! Incorrect dilution can lead to undesirable outcomes.
